/**
 * This is meant as a thin wrapper around
 * ApiPlatform\Metadata\Property\Factory\SerializerPropertyMetadataFactory.
 * That class implements the automatic embedding logic based on serialization groups,
 * described in https://api-platform.com/docs/core/serialization/#embedding-relations.
 *
 * However, we have our own system for serialization groups and embedding entities,
 * with general groups 'read', 'write', 'create', 'update' etc. instead of entity-
 * specific groups as they are used in the API platform docs ('book', 'book:update').
 * Therefore, we don't want relations to be automatically embedded as soon as there
 * is a property with a matching serialization group on the related entity.
 *
 * As an example, we don't want the author to be embedded in the book here:
 *
 * #[ApiResource(normalization_context: ['groups' => ['read']])]
 * class Book {
 *   #[Groups('read')]
 *   public ?Person $author = null;
 * }
 *
 * #[ApiResource(normalization_context: ['groups' => ['read']])]
 * class Person {
 *   #[Groups('read')]
 *   public string $name = '';
 * }
 *
 * To prevent the author from being embedded due to just the 'read' group, this
 * class should be inserted just around SerializerPropertyMetadataFactory in the
 * decorator chain. It will undo only the undesired changes to the property
 * metadata that SerializerPropertyMetadataFactory adds.
 *
 * Currently, the SerializerPropertyMetadataFactory has a decoration priority of
 * 30, so this class should be assigned a priority of 29.
