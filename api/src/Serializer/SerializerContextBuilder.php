 * Adds some common settings to the normalization_context and denormalization_context, so that

 *
 * **NOTE**: The context that is set up here is ignored when building the OpenAPI documentation.
 * This means that we shouldn't put any configuration in here that should be reflected in the
 * API documentation. Settings such as skip_null_values and allow_extra_attributes are okay, but
 * settings such as groups are not, because the groups need to be taken into account when
 * building the payload schemas for the API documentation.
